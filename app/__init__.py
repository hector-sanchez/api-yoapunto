"""
App Package - Main Application Module

This is the root package for the YoApunto API application.
It contains all the core components organized into logical submodules:

- models: Database table definitions (SQLAlchemy models)
- schemas: Data validation and serialization (Pydantic models)
- crud: Business logic and database operations
- api: HTTP endpoints and routing

This clean separation follows the "separation of concerns" principle,
making the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
